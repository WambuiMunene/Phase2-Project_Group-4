    "As a car hire company, understanding the factors influencing fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and customer preferences is critical to selecting the right mix of vehicles. This project aims to analyze car makes and models using SQL for data extraction and linear regression to identify trends in fuel consumption, engine performance, and other key metrics. By leveraging historical data on vehicle specifications and performance, we can predict which car models align best with our business needs, ensuring a balance between operational costs and customer satisfaction."

    "In the car hire industry, selecting the right vehicles for a fleet is crucial to balancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Car hire companies must choose vehicles that not only meet customer expectations in terms of reliability and comfort but also minimize costs related to fuel, maintenance, and depreciation. With numerous car makes and models available, each with unique specifications and performance metrics, making data-driven decisions becomes essential to avoid costly mistakes in fleet investments.\n",

    "As a data scientist I have been tasked to analyze historical data on various car makes and models to determine the most fuel effective vehicle make and models with the least carbon emmisions. By examining these factors we aim to create a model that predicts the best car choices. "

    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Trend Analysis\n",
    "a. Trend analysis to identify average fuel consumption for the top 3 makes in each vehicle class over time\n",
    "b. Trend analysis to identify average emissions for the top 3 makes in each vehicle class over time\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regression Analysis\n",
    "a. Effect of engine size on fuel efficiency\n",
    "b. Effect of fuel consumption as measured by 'Comb (L/100 KM) and emissions\n",
