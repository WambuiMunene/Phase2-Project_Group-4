    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A car hire business also refered to as a car rental business provides vehicles for short-term use, usually ranging from a few hours to several days or weeks, to customers who require temporary transportation. This business is necessary in catering to individuals or businesses who do not own a car, those who need an extra vehicle for travel, or people who require specific types of vehicles for particular occasions. Car hire businesses are often part of the larger transportation and travel industries, serving both local and international customers. The car hire business operates by renting out a fleet of vehicles, often located at various rental locations, such as airports, train stations, or urban centers. These businesses offer a variety of vehicles ranging from economy cars to luxury cars, SUVs, vans, and trucks depending on customer demand. Some companies may also specialize in niche markets like luxury car rentals, wedding cars, or electric vehicle rentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "V magic Limited company now sees all the big companies diversifying to car rental business and they want to get in on the fun. They have to decide which cars to purchase depending on make, model, fuel consumption, emissions etc. I am charged with exploring what model and make of cars that are currently doing the best at the car rental industry. I must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of the company's car rental session can use to help him decide what type of make and model of cars to purchase. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    " 1.\tAnalyze vehicle performance across different makes and models, through assesment of the fuel efficiency and engine size\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Identify the most popular vehicle classes for car rental business by examining the relationship between vehicle class and rental market demand.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Evaluate the cost and environmental impact of potential fleet vehicles using fuel consumption and emissions.\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. Perform a comparative analysis of vehicle makes and models.\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. Analyze the relationship between transmission type and fuel consumption to determine how different transmission types impact the fuel efficiency of vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    " 6. Evaluate the relationship between Fuel type and Emissions."

    "### Data Source\n",
    "For this project, we are working with a dataset that was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmettyilmazz/fuel-consumption), the dataset contains information on a variety of vehicles, focusing on attributes such as make, model, vehicle class, engine size, fuel consumption, emissions, and other key features that are relevant for analyzing the performance and suitability of cars for a car hire business.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Description\n",
    "The dataset includes the following key attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Year: The model year of the vehicle.\n",
    "2. Make: The manufacturer or brand of the vehicle. \n",
    "3. Model: The specific model of the vehicle. \n",
    "4. Vehicle Class: The category or class of the vehicle.\n",
    "5. Engine Size: The size of the engine in liters.\n",
    "6. Cylinders: The number of cylinders in the engine.\n",
    "7. Transmission: The type of transmissiontic.\n",
    "8. Fuel: The type of fuel used by the vehicle.\n",
    "9. Fuel Consumption: The fuel consumption in liters per 100 kilometers.\n",
    "10. Highway Fuel Consumption (HWY): Fuel consumption on the highway in liters per 100 kilometers.\n",
    "11. Combined Fuel Consumption (COMB): The combined fuel consumption (city + highway) in liters per 100 kilometers.\n",
    "12. Combined Fuel Economy (COMB MPG): The combined fuel economy in miles per gallon.\n",
    "13. Emissions: The CO2 emissions of the vehicle in grams per kilometer."

    "1.\tSince fuel consumption is significantly influenced by engine size, V Magic should consider smaller engine sizes for better fuel efficiency. Lower fuel consumption translates to lower operational costs, which can improve profit margins, especially if fuel expenses are a large part of rental overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tChoose vehicles with lower fuel consumption to minimize emissions. The analysis clearly shows that higher fuel consumption leads to higher emissions. By selecting fuel-efficient vehicles, V Magic can reduce its environmental impact, aligning with sustainability goals and appealing to eco-conscious customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tBased on the data, the Hyundai Tucson Hybrid AM6 transmission is the best choice with the lowest fuel consumption (6.80 L/100 km). This means it uses the least fuel for the same distance, offering the most cost-effective operation. Transmission types like AV1, M4, and AV10 follow closely in terms of fuel efficiency, making them strong candidates as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Prioritize Low-Emission Fuel Types, since fuel type considerably impacts emissions, select vehicles that use fuels associated with lower emissions.             "
