    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we analyze fuel consumption data from various car models between 2000 and 2022. Given rising fuel costs and current economic constraints, consumers are increasingly prioritizing fuel-efficient vehicles. Our client, Emmotoka Car Dealers, a new car dealership in Uganda with the tagline \"Motor is driving made affordable,\" is focused on stocking vehicles that offer the best fuel efficiency and are no more than 14 years old. This study aims to uncover key trends in fuel efficiency and identify factors influencing fuel consumption, providing Emmotoka with data-driven insights to help them select the ideal inventory to meet consumer needs.\n"
