# Phase-2_Group-4

In this project, we have been tasked to advise a new start-up company thatis venturing into the car rental industry. Since this company is based inCanada, we have obtained a dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/ that is based on original data from https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64 that details fuel consumption and emissions for various makes and models from 2000 to 2022.

Using this dataset we will: 
- Investigate car industry insights on fuel consumption, emissions, fuel types, engine sizes, and transmission types.
- Analyze the dataset to identify the makes with optimal fuel efficiency and low emissions.
- Perform statistical tests to understand how vehicle characteristics like fuel type and engine size influence fuel consumption and emissions.
- Provide actionable recommendations for the company to build an efficient, low-emission fleet.

We will present our findings in a technical notebook that has the details of our analysis, observations, visualizations and conclusions. We will also provide a non-technical powerpoint presentation summarizing our findings and providing recommendations for our clien to use in their fleet selection.
